    Generic helper that polls a state until the operation is completed or an unexpected state is encountered.

    Args:
        check_fn (callable): A function that returns a tuple (is_completed, current_state).
        resource_identifier (str): A string identifier for the resource (for logging).
        waiting_states (list): States that indicate the process is still in progress.
        max_retries (int): Maximum number of retry attempts.
        backoff_interval (int): Initial backoff interval in seconds.
        max_backoff (int): Maximum backoff interval in seconds.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to check_fn.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the operation completed successfully, False otherwise.
